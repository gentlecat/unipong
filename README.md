# UniPong

Clone of a good ol' arcade game - [Pong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong).
Implemented in [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) engine.

## How to play

AI is not implemented yet, so you'll have to play with yourself or a friend.

### Controls
Player 1:  
**Q**/**W** - Move up  
**A**/**S** - Move down

Player 2:  
**Arrow Up** - Move up  
**Arrow Down** - Move down

## How to run
There is a web version at http://tsukanov.github.io/unipong/. It uses [Unity Web Player](http://unity3d.com/webplayer/).

No other builds available yet, but you can make one yourself using the editor. Editor is available for Windows and Mac OS X at http://unity3d.com/download.
After you download Unity, import the project and either [build the game](http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules/beginner/editor/build-player-settings) or run it directly in [the game view](http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules/beginner/editor/the-game-view).

Enjoy!
